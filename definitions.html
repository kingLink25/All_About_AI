            <h1>What is AI</h1>
            
            <p class="main-text">
           Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

                <h2> Types of AI</h2>
                <p class="main2-text">There are three typess of AI, ANI, AGI, ASI.<br><br>
    <strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</strong><br>
 ANI, also known as Narrow AI or Weak AI, is a type of Artificial Intelligence focused on one single narrow task. It possesses a narrow-range of abilities. This is the only AI in existence today, for now. Narrow AI is something most of us interact with on a daily basis. Think of Google Assistant, Google Translate, Siri, Cortana, or Alexa.<br><br>
                    <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) </strong><br>
When we talk about AGI we refer to a type of AI that is about as capable as a human. However, AGI is still an emerging field. Since the human brain is the model to creating General Intelligence, it seems unlike that will happen relatively soon because there is lack of a comprehensive knowledge of the functionality of the human brain.<br><br>
                    <strong>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</strong><br>
ASI is way into the future. Or, that is what we believe. To reach this point and to be called an ASI, an AI will need to surpass humans at absolutely everything. The ASI type is achieved when AI is more capable than a human.This type of AI will be able to perform extraordinary well at things such as arts, decision making, and emotional relationships. </p>
