            <h1>Domains of AI</h1>
            <p class="main-text">
            There are three main domains of AI,<strong> Data</strong>,<strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>,<strong> Computer Vision</strong>.
            </p>
                
            <h2>Data</h2>  
            <p class="main2-text">
            Data is the basic foundation that helps support AI. With a sufficient amount of data will the AI be able to make good and informed decisions. There are three types of Data, sound data for voice recognition systems, Text data for atomatic classifying systems, and image and video data for compute vision systems.
                </p>
            
            
                
            <h2>NLP</h2>
            <p class="main3-text">
            Natural Language Processing, is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using their Natural Language
            The ultimate goal of NLP is to decipher, understand, and make sense of the human's language.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
            <p class="main4-text">
             Computer Visison is the only way the AI can be aware of its surrounding. Humans use their vision the most to be aware of their surroundings, and the goal of Computer Vision is to give that same level of awareness as a human to the AI.
